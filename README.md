Battleship program with rudimentary easy and hard "AI"


Notes about starting the game:
- Run the program Battleship.m
- Your board is on the left. Click to place all ships in descending size order (5, 4, 3, 3, 2)
- After placing ships you will make a guess on the right side of the board by clicking a square
- Regular battleship rules apply until there is a winner
